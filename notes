Run words splitting from:
- text area
- upload file / srt file
- add a url to a html page articles (maybe do a page with displayed article and highlight unknown words) + lyrics sites or albums

Other ideas:
- download srt files with styling of unknown words
- add page with option to search records by grup of words to learn (ordered by number of occurences of words)
- page with known word (to remove from list)
- add option to parse html from genius: link/album and lyricstranslate
    
Lyrics / text to add:
- husky album
- Tamara's video
- srt from movies/series you known
