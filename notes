Run words splitting from:
- text area
- upload file / srt file
- add a url to a html page articles (maybe do a page with displayed article and highlight unknown words) + lyrics sites or albums

Other ideas:
- download srt files with styling of unknown words
- add page with option to search records by grup of words to learn (ordered by number of occurences of words)
- page with known word (to remove from list)
- add option to parse html from genius: link/album and lyricstranslate
    
Lyrics / text to add:
- husky album
- Tamara's video
- srt from movies/series you known

TODO: -> remove from react history the data record (on refresh it stays on even if deleted)

TODO: -> fix regex match for symbols in cyrilics
TODO: -> auto generate name for add-text when name field is empty
TODO: -> clear errors after pasting valid values in add-text
TODO: -> see what can be done about cors issues
TODO: -> paste doesn't work firefox (maybe there is something to ask permission from user)
TODO: -> add tampermonkey extension that takes the url as parameter redirects you to add url record
        make a build script for this thing, it should use the url sources to match websites navigated
TODO: -> manage ".m" sites, it should match mobile urls and make requests to the desktop ones
TODO: -> add support for RadioFreedom and Wikipedia
TODO: -> add conditional rendering on scrolling for long contents (seems like in android doesn't have the power to render too much items)
         maybe you can make render an empty div to manage that, maybe you can find some react pure component or something

TODO: -> add something nice to the meta data so the url looks nice when pasted somewhere
TODO: -> made the content font and feel look nice
TODO: -> add name with autofill for file record page
