Run words splitting from:
- text area
- upload file / srt file
- add a url to a html page articles (maybe do a page with displayed article and highlight unknown words) + lyrics sites or albums

Other ideas:
- download srt files with styling of unknown words
- add page with option to search records by grup of words to learn (ordered by number of occurences of words)
- page with known word (to remove from list)
- add option to parse html from genius: link/album and lyricstranslate
    
Lyrics / text to add:
- husky album
- Tamara's video
- srt from movies/series you known


TODO: -> remove from history the data record
TODO: -> auto name for add-text
TODO: -> remove error after pasting in add-text
TODO: -> see what can be done about cors issues
TODO: -> paste doesn't work firefox (maybe there is something to ask permission from user)
TODO: -> add tampermonkey extension that takes the url as parameter redirects you to add url record
TODO: -> add conditional rendering on scrolling for long contents (seems like in android doesn't have the power to render too much items)
         maybe you can make render an empty div to manage that, maybe you can find some react pure component or something
